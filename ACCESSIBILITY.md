# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices that should be followed to ensure the project is inclusive and usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility ensures that:
- People with disabilities can use and benefit from your project.
- Your project complies with legal and ethical standards.
- You reach a broader audience by making your project more inclusive.

## Accessibility Standards

This project follows the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1**, which are organized into four main principles:

### 1. **Perceivable**
- **Provide text alternatives** for non-text content (e.g., images, videos).
- Ensure content is **adaptable** and can be presented in different ways (e.g., screen readers).
- Make sure text has sufficient **contrast** against its background.

### 2. **Operable**
- Ensure all functionality is accessible via **keyboard navigation**.
- Provide users with enough time to read and use content.
- Avoid content that causes **seizures** (e.g., flashing animations).
- Provide clear and consistent **navigation**.

### 3. **Understandable**
- Use clear and simple language.
- Ensure the interface behaves in a **predictable** way.
- Provide **helpful error messages** and instructions.

### 4. **Robust**
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of **assistive technologies** (e.g., screen readers, magnifiers).
- Use semantic HTML and follow coding standards.

## Best Practices for Accessibility

### 1. **Design**
- Use high-contrast colors for text and backgrounds.
- Ensure buttons and links are large enough to be easily clickable.
- Provide visible focus indicators for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links).

### 2. **Development**
- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to structure content.
- Add `aria-label` attributes to improve screen reader support.
- Test keyboard navigation to ensure all functionality is accessible without a mouse.

### 3. **Testing**
- Use automated tools to check for accessibility issues:
  - [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) (browser extension).
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (built into Chrome DevTools).
- Perform manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
- Test with users who have disabilities, if possible.

## Accessibility Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your project meets accessibility standards:

### General
- [ ] All images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
- [ ] Text has sufficient color contrast (use tools like [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)).
- [ ] Headings are used in a logical order (e.g., `<h1>` followed by `<h2>`).

### Navigation
- [ ] All functionality is accessible via keyboard.
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible for all interactive elements.
- [ ] Skip links are provided to allow users to bypass repetitive content.

### Forms
- [ ] All form fields have associated `<label>` elements.
- [ ] Error messages are clear and provide guidance on how to fix the issue.
- [ ] Required fields are clearly indicated.

### Media
- [ ] Videos have captions or transcripts.
- [ ] Audio content has transcripts.
- [ ] Animations can be paused or disabled.
